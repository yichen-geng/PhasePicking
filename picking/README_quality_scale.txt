Each pick is assigned a quality score ranging from 1 to 5, based on the visibility of the signal in record section, noise level before the signal (i.e. change in amplitude from noise and signal) and change in frequency content. The following list the criteria for each score. Note that these are only rough criteria to rely upon.

5: The signal is visible in the record section; low noise level before the signal; almost no uncertainty in picking
4: The signal is visible in the record section; low-medium noise level before the signal
3: The signal is visible in the record section; medium-high noise level before the signal
2: The signal is visible in the record section; high noise level before the signal; no clear change in amplitude but visible change in frequency content
1: The signal is not visible neither in the record section nor in the individual trace
